# 📊 Task 3: SQL for Data Analysis

## 🧠 Objective  
The goal of this task is to extract and analyze structured data using SQL. This involves writing SQL queries to manipulate, retrieve, and analyze data from an ecommerce database (or any structured dataset of choice).

## 🛠️ Tools Used  
- SQL Engine: `MySQL` / `PostgreSQL` / `SQLite` (choose the one you used)  
- DB Browser for SQLite / pgAdmin / MySQL Workbench (as applicable)  
- Dataset: `Ecommerce_SQL_Database` (or mention the dataset you used)

```

## ✅ Task Highlights  
- Basic SQL operations using `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`
- Use of different `JOIN` types: `INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`
- Writing subqueries for advanced filtering and aggregation
- Usage of aggregate functions: `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`
- Created SQL views for recurring analyses
- Indexed columns to optimize query performance


## 📸 Output  
Screenshots of SQL query outputs have been added in the `screenshots` folder.
