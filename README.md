# 📊 Task 3: SQL for Data Analysis

## 🧠 Objective  
The goal of this task is to extract and analyze structured data using SQL. This involves writing SQL queries to manipulate, retrieve, and analyze data from an ecommerce database (or any structured dataset of choice).

## 🛠️ Tools Used  
- SQL Engine: `MySQL` / `PostgreSQL` / `SQLite` (choose the one you used)  
- DB Browser for SQLite / pgAdmin / MySQL Workbench (as applicable)  
- Dataset: `Ecommerce_SQL_Database` (or mention the dataset you used)

```

## ✅ Task Highlights  
- Basic SQL operations using `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`
- Use of different `JOIN` types: `INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`
- Writing subqueries for advanced filtering and aggregation
- Usage of aggregate functions: `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`
- Created SQL views for recurring analyses
- Indexed columns to optimize query performance
- Query examples for business metrics like average revenue per user (ARPU), total sales, user segmentation, etc.

## 📚 Sample Interview Questions Answered  
- Difference between `WHERE` and `HAVING`  
- Types of SQL `JOIN`s  
- What are subqueries and how to use them  
- Optimizing SQL queries using `INDEX`, `EXPLAIN`, etc.  
- Use of `VIEW` in SQL for simplifying complex queries  
- Handling `NULL` values with `COALESCE()` and `IS NULL`

## 📸 Output  
Screenshots of SQL query outputs have been added in the `screenshots` folder.

## 📌 How to Run  
1. Open the SQL file (`queries.sql`) in your preferred SQL IDE  
2. Connect to the provided ecommerce database  
3. Run the queries to explore and analyze the dataset
